I: Write a method to replace all the spaces in a string with %20 instead.

D: Goal is to take a string break it in to its characters and replace the spaces with 
%20 symbol.

E,A: Duke 7 steps
1.string "a " will become "a%20"
String "a s" will become "a%20s"

2.I took the string "a " and broke it down to its characters. the i replaced the spaces with %20. 
then i combined the charactersback into a string in the same order.

3.Patterns: breaking down string into characters.

4.String "a "----> 'a', ' '----> 'a','%20'----->"a%20"

5.public StringBuilder problem3(String s)
{
 String[] chars = new String[s.length()];
 StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
 
 for(int i =0;i<s.length();i++)
 {
 if(s.charAt(i) == ' ')
 {
 chars[i] = "%20";
 builder.append(chars[i]);
 }
 else
 {
 builder.append(s.charAt(i));
 }
 }
 return builder;
}

6.null String, empty string.

7.Will have to catch or throw exception for null, and return an error message for an empty string

L: I learned that you can use a stringBuilder to concatinate strings into one object.

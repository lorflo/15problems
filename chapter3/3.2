I: Design a stack with a min feature to return the smallest element

D:Goal is to be able to return smallest element in stack by calling stack.min()

E,A: Duke 7 steps
1.Stack.add(9) min is 9 add(4) compare---->min 4 add(2)compare to current min, min is 2.
add(10) compare to current min, min is 2.

2. Every time an element is added to the stack compare it to the current min. if its smaller
it becomes the new min.

3.Patterns:

4.(same as 1.)Stack.add(9) min is 9 add(4) compare---->min 4 add(2)compare to current min, min is 2.
add(10) compare to current min, min is 2.

5.code in file.

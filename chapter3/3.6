I: Create stack that is ordered with the larger items on top.

D: Goal is to end up with a sorted stack

E,A: Duke 7 steps
1.stack(2,3,1,5,8,6,7)------> newStack(1,2,3,5,6,7,8)

2. pop top into a new stack ,then peek and compare the two. if peek is smaller switch the two.
repeat until the new stack is sorted from smallest to biggest.

3.Pattern:

4. stack(2,3,1,5,8,6,7) --> newStack(7),stack(2,3,1,5,8,6)----> compare 6,7 
---> newStack(6),stack(2,3,1,5,8,7).....newStack(6,7,5,1,3,2,8)

5.code in file

6.null stack, empty stack

7.throw or catch exception for null

L: how to use two stacks in a recursive method to generate a sorted stack

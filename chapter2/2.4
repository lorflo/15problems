I: dived a list at a certain node so that all nodes less than it are put before it and all nodes greater than or equal to it.

D: Goal is to have two seperate arrays for before and after the node to partition, then merge the two.

E,A: Duke 7 steps
1.3->5->8->5->10->2->1[partition = 5] -----> 3->1->2->10->5->5->8

2.find all values before the partition where ever it appears, then put them in a list.
put the rest into another list and merge the two.

3.Patterns: 

4.list(3,5,8,5,10,2,1) -----> listbefore(3,2,1) and listafter(5,5,8,10)
merge -----> listfinal(3,2,1,5,5,8,10)

5.code: couldnt figure out solution is from book.

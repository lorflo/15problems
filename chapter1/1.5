I: See if two strings are one or none edits away from becoming one another.

D: Goal is to check length of one string and compare to other, then check if only one letter is \
different. then return if they are one or none edits away from each other.

E,A: Duke 7 steps
1.string "bake" string "bak" one edit away. string "bog" string"dog" one edit away.

2.chek length of strings and if they contain the same letters by putting both into different arrays.

3.Patterns: have to put strings into arrays 

4."bake"----> [b,a,k,e] "bak"--->[b,a,k]. letters same just off by one. retun one edit away.

5.code in file

6.null string, empty string. 

7.Need to catch or throw exception for null string.

L: Easy to compare arrays

I-Determine if a String has only different characters.

D-The goal is to return a boolean value if the string has any characters that repeat.

E/A- Duke 7 steps
1. A small inastance would be the string "aa". Putting it in the set would only put 'a'. 
So the length of the string and size of set would be different resulting in false. If the 
string were "ab", or"a ", the method would return true.

2.I made a Hashset because it doesn't allow for duplicates in the set. Then i put the string 
character by character into the set. Compare the size of the set to the length of the string.

3. A pattern here is its good to use a hashset when you want to get rid of duplicate values.

4. Trace: String "aa" ---> 'a','a'. characters passed into set. set contains('a'). 
string length is 2. set size is 1. compare the two values and see they are different.
return false ti indicate the string is not made up of only unique values.

6.Test cases: an empty string, string with spaces and letters, String with only one character,
null String. 

7.If you pass a null String you will get a null pointer exception, so you have to throw an 
exception or check if string is null before hand.

L: I learned that a HashSet is good to use when you want to get rid of duplicate values of data.

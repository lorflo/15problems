I: Determine if one string contains the same characters the same number of times as another 
string, if so then they are permutations of one another.

D: My goal is to take a string, divide it up into its characters, and compare another string
to those characters, returning a boolean statement.

E,A: Duke 7 steps
1.String "and" <------> string "dan" are permutations
String "an" <---x---> "am" are not permutations
String "and" <---x---> "annd" are not permutations

2.I can see that "and" and "dan" contain the same letters the same number of times so i know 
they are permutations, but "an" and "am" are off by one letter so they are not permutations, 
just like "and" and "annd".

3.Patterns: will have to check the characters of the strings, can use an array , but also the 
length immedeatly tells if they are permutations.

4.First compare lengths. If different, then not permutations. Next put characters of one string 
into an array and sort it.then do the same to the other string. and compare the elements of the strings.

5.code in file

6.null String(s), empty Strings, Strings with spaces.

7.For null strings will have to throw or cathch an exception.

L: I learned that sorting arrays can be useful.

I: Determine if a string is a permutaion of a palindrome

D: Goal is to break up a string and see if it is a palandrome. Then if it is see if it is a permutation.
Return a boolean value.

E,A: Duke 7 steps
1.String "tact coa" ---> only one letter appears once and others have a pair, its a palandrone.
if its a palindrome its a permutation.

2.Split up a string and check the number of times the letters appear. If there is only one letter that 
appears only once, or an odd number of times, then it is the center. the other letters should have an 
even number of appearences.

3.Patterns: checking for duplicate values of data. splitting up strings.

4. "tact coa" ----> 2 t's, 2'a's, 2'c's, 1'o. is a palindrome, so is a permutation. return true.

5.code in file.

6.null strings, empty strings

7.code didnt work.

L: There are many problems involving splitting up strings.
